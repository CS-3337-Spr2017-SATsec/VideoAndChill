A video sharing service where one can easily watch a video with other(s) synced up in real-time.

Anyone can control the playback (pause/repay/jump forward/backwards, etc.) if needed to.

The connection will either be done though a website or ip-address.

### How It Works
First a user will initiate the application by setting up a server. Then the user can invite others by sharing their respective room link or ip-address. The other user can connect this way and will be able to start watching videos together. Lastly, they will have to either upload videos and paste links from YouTube or other video streaming websites in order to begin watching.
