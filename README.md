## How It Works
First the user will initiate the application by setting up a server. Then the user can invite others by sharing their respective room link or an IP address. The other user can connect this way and will be able to start watching videos together. Lastly, they will have to either upload videos, paste links from YouTube, or other video streaming websites in order to begin watching.
